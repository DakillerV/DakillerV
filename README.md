# Allen Taylor - Full Stack Web Developer

Greetings! My name is Allen Taylor, and I am a full stack web developer with a particular focus on the MERN stack. Within this GitHub repository, I have collected several significant projects that I have built using this technology stack.

## Projects

### Hangman Game / Built with React js With Vite and Node js

Active time: ~1.5 months

I am currently working on a React.js and Vite port of the classic game of hangman. I have implemented several innovative features into this project, including socket.io connections for an in-game chat system and a basic friend and group/direct messaging system.

### Google Forms Clone / Built with React js and Node js

Active time: 3 months

I have also built a replica of the popular form builder Google Forms. While I have not yet had the opportunity to fully finish this project, I have hosted a public version of the app at formme.tk. I have also used a Docker container run with Portainer and proxied with an Nginx Proxy Manager, all running on my home server.

### Discord Bot / Built with Node js

Active time: ~2 years

Over the last two years, I have developed a Discord bot that was originally built for my friends and me to have in a Discord server and to mess around with. I have hosted this bot on Heroku and continue to work on its development.
